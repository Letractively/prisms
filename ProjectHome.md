PRISMS is a java server framework that allows for quick and easy development of very sophisticated and dynamic web services.  It was developed with a DHTML front-end in mind and comes with several front-end web tools constructed using the Dojo 1.1.1 framework, but it can be used for machine-to-machine communication or to construct a front-end in any other language as well.  It is conducive to data-centered and modular applications and greatly eases maintenance and enhancement.

The PRISMS framework is in use and consistent development, constantly being stabilized, added to and improved. These changes are typically applied in a large batch every few months.

See the [High Level Overview](HighLevelOverview.md)

PRISMS also has many utilities for data manipulation, some of which do not require integration with the framework as a whole.  Check out the [utility](http://code.google.com/p/prisms/wiki/PRISMSUtilities) list.
